# Racing Data Manager
This project was created to help me practice using the Pandas and NumPy libraries in Python, all while diving into my favorite passion: racing.
In the initial version of the code, I used dictionaries to store lap information. However, I can enhance the structure by either importing functions or using classes in combination with dictionaries. 
"Feel free to contact me with any suggestions. I'm still learning and open to feedback!
